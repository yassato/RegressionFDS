# Regression model of frequency-dependent selection  

## Overview  
This reporsitory stores source codes and original data generated by Sato et al. "".  

## Directory

### /simulation
A folder including SLiM and GWAS simulations.  

SLiM codes (xxxx.slim) for  
- negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS);  
- positive frequency-dependent selection (PFDS);  
- overdominance (OD);  
- and Spatio-temporally varying selection (STVS).  

GWAS simulation using the SLiM outputs.  

/output  
Folder to store SLiM and GWAS output files.  

### /application
